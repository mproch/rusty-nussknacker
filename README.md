# rusty-nussknacker

The plan:
- Parse Nussknacker JSON with request-response scenario
- Pass request as JSON
- Be able to use:
  - filter
  - source/sink
  - variable
  - switch (?)
- The expressions will be defined in JS
- Also - query on arrow :)

Further development:
- JS invoked with WASM?
- Exposing scenario as HTTP API or/and Kafka consumer
- Support OpenAPI enrichments :)
